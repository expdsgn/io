  <blockquote>exp. design's mission is to create outstanding digital experiences for social impact organizations using research, strategy, design, and technology.</blockquote>

  My name is [Devon Hirth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devonhirth) and my digital product experience ranges from human-centered design research to prototyping, engineering, and market delivery. Currently, I'm working with [The Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity](nyc.gov/opportunity) (NYC Opportunity), part of the Mayor's Office of Operations, which works to reduce poverty and broaden opportunities for New York City residents. As a designer and engineer, I have come up against many creative and technical challenges, and I derive a great deal of satisfaction overcoming them. One design practice that I value the most is listening to people and enabling them to solve their most significant challenges.
